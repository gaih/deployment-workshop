In addition to this, version control grants historical versions to a project, like a backup, which can be traced back in case of a crash or a mistake. There are two types of version control, **centralized** and **distributed**. The main difference is, while in a centralized version control each user only gets their own copy, while in distributed version control they may also get their own repository. We will be working on some examples from a distributed version control system (Git)."
